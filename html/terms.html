        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and Musica (“we,” “us,” or “our”), concerning your access to and use of Musica, including any other media form, media channel, website, mobile website, or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Bot”).

Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Bot so that you understand which Terms apply.
